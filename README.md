# ðŸ“·Visual Object Recognition Program

- Project Duration : 2023.01 ~ 2023.02
- Project Description : Embedded system designed for recognizing and defining objects captured by a camera using deep learning-trained image data. (data : Imagenet_2017).

---
Constructed both the embedded system and the computational pipeline, developing a Python algorithm for image classification in a TensorFlow session, and interpreting results in LabVIEW program designed for image reception.

---
## LabVIEW
- Out put : Visual Object Recognition
- When the camera captures an object, the program will detect the object and classify it based on the training image data.

### Step3. sub Vi - converting the data type, which is used to store images and is different from the data type handled in Python, into a data type that can be used for both.
