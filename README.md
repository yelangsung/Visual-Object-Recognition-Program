# ðŸ“·Visual Object Recognition Program

- Project Duration : 2023.01 ~ 2023.02
- Project Description : Embedded system designed for recognizing and defining objects captured by a camera using deep learning-trained image data. (data : Imagenet_2017).

---
Constructed both the embedded system and the computational pipeline, developing a Python algorithm for image classification in a TensorFlow session, and interpreting results in LabVIEW program designed for image reception.
